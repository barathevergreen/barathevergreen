## ðŸ‘€  Intro: 

__Automation Engineer turned Data Scientist__ with a life long learning mindset, exposure across banking and telco domains and solid foundations in data science. 

Strong apprehensions in __Data Science and Machine Learning Stack, AWS - Cloud Components and Sagemaker Stack__, Automation and Service Virtualization, Cybersecurity - Vulnerability Analysis, Project/Vendor Management.

These invaluable experiences and product knowledge have equipped me to handle evolving roles and responsibilities in end-to-end software & Data Science project lifecycles. 

As a Data and Cloud Aspirant, I constantly acquire new skills to adapt to trends through self learning experiments, kaggle, MOOCs and projects.
